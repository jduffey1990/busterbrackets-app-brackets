## 🧪 Seeding the Database

You can populate the brackets collection with a default seed script (must run AFTER users seed script):

- **Locally:**
  ```bash
  npm run seed
  ```

- **With Docker Compose:**
  ```bash
  npm run docker-seed
  ```

## 🧩 API Responsibilities

This service is responsible for:

- Creating and saving new brackets
- Handling bracket "offshoots" (alternative versions)
- Fetching bracket data by user
- Managing bracket history and updates

## 🐳 Docker

If you're running this as part of a full-stack app:

- Make sure `docker-compose.yml` includes the correct service and MongoDB configuration.  Locally, `docker-compose.yml` is necessary to map the ports properly versus the self-contained microservices in production

'''

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:8
    container_name: mongo
